Covered the concept of grouping Azure resources for:
- Easier management  
- Consistent organization  
- Bulk updating or deletion  

Resource Groups form the backbone of deploying and structuring cloud environments.


### 🖥️ 4. Compute Services Overview  
Studied the main compute service types:
- **Virtual Machines**  
- **App Services**  
- **Azure Functions**  

Each service type supports different hosting needs, from serverless to fully managed compute.


### 🔗 5. Networking Essentials  
Learned how Azure handles networking through:
- **Virtual Networks**  
- **Subnets**  
- **Network security**  
- **Hybrid connectivity options** (VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute)

These elements enable secure communication within Azure and between on-premises systems.


### 📦 6. Storage Services  
Explored Azure’s storage solutions, including:
- **Blob Storage**  
- **Disk Storage**  
- **File Shares**  
- Storage access tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive)

Each storage type serves different workloads based on frequency of access and cost requirements.


### 🗄️ 7. Database Services  
Reviewed Azure database offerings:
- **Azure SQL Database**  
- **Cosmos DB**

Focused on understanding their use cases, scalability features, and global distribution options.


### 🔐 8. Identity, Access & Security  
Studied essential security concepts in Azure:
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- **Zero Trust principles**  
- **Networking security tools** (NSGs, firewalls)

These components enable secure authentication, authorization, and resource protection.


### 📜 9. Governance & Compliance  
Learned Azure governance tools, such as:
- **Azure Policy**  
- **Tags**  
- **Resource Locks**  
- **Azure Blueprints**

These tools enforce organizational standards, protect critical assets, and maintain compliance.


### 💰 10. Pricing, Cost Management & SLAs  
Covered essential cost-related Azure topics:
- Pay-as-you-go pricing  
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)  
- Pricing Calculator  
- Cost Management tools  
- Azure SLAs (Service Level Agreements)

This section emphasized understanding cloud costs and how to manage them effectively.

Every highlight reflects the core Azure concepts, diagrams, and explanations included in the training content.
